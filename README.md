## 0x1D. C - Binary trees ##

## Description

```
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
```

## Installation ##
If you want to run the command interpreter follow the next steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/maycolroa/AirBnB_clone

2. Access AirBnB_clone directory: cd AirBnB_clone

3. Run: ./console.py

- help - Gives a little description of a command.
- create - Creates a new instance.
- show - Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
- detroy - Deletes an instance based on the class name and id.
